        <h3>Programming experience</h3>
        <p>
            My Interest in Programming, I dont have much programming experience yet, but Ive recently become really interested in it. I find it
            fascinating how apps, websites, and software are created using code. It made me want to learn more about how
            everything works behind the scenes. Ive started watching online tutorials and have begun exploring basic programming languages like HTML and
            JavaScript. Even though Im still learning, the idea that I can create something useful with code excites
            me. Ive realized that programming is not just about writing codeâ€”it also involves problem-solving and creative
            thinking, which I really enjoy. While I dont have much experience now, Im eager to learn more and improve
            my skills as I practice.
