        <h3>First feedback</h3>
        <p> One aspect that was mentioned positively was my ability to organize my thoughts clearly. This showed me that
            my structure was solid, and that I had a good foundation to build.
            The feedback also pointed out that some parts of my analysis could be more detailed.
            I was encouraged to dive deeper into certain topics to provide a more thorough understanding. Additionally,
            it was suggested that I could focus on using more specific examples to support my arguments.
            I found the feedback valuable, as it gave me a clear direction on how to improve. While I was
            pleased with the positive points, I also saw the opportunity to make my work stronger by incorporating the
            suggestions. Im planning to apply this feedback in future assignments to ensure that my analysis is both
            detailed and well-supported.
