        <h3>Study choice</h3>
        <p> My choice to study ICT came from my great interest in technology and digital
            world. From an early age I was fascinated by how computers and systems work. I discovered that ICT
            is not just about using technology, but also about understanding, creating and improving it.

            The versatility of the ICT sector really appealed to me. It is a field that is constantly evolving,
            with endless opportunities to learn new things and grow. Whether it concerns software development,
            networks or cybersecurity, the impact that ICT has on the modern world is enormous. This constant innovation
            and progress stimulate my curiosity and urge to keep learning.
            What also attracted me is the possibility of using ICT to provide concrete solutions to everyday problems.
            From improving business processes to developing apps that make people's lives easier
            to make. ICT gives me the opportunity to think creatively and analytically, and to contribute to technology
            future.
            With this choice of study, I not only see an exciting career, but also an opportunity to continuously improve myself
            continue to develop in a world that never stands still.
