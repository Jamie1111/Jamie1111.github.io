      <h3>HBO-ICT</h3>
      <p>I chose the ICT course because I had been working with technology and computers for a long time. I find
        it's interesting how systems, software and networks work, and I would like to learn how I can develop them
        improve. ICT is a field in which you can learn a lot about solving problems and finding solutions
        technical solutions, something that has always appealed to me. I've never really delved into the
        programming aspect and I thought it would be fun to learn this and continue working with it later.
        In addition, there is a high demand for IT professionals, which gives me good chances of a job after my studies.

      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      <p>I chose the ICT course because I have always been interested in computers and technology.
        I love how technology can make our lives easier and how you can do so many different things with it
        can do.
        What really attracts me is that I can make things work better with ICT. It makes me feel good when I do
        can solve problems and ensure that something goes faster or more conveniently.
        I like to solve problems. If something isn't working, I like to figure out how to fix it
        improve and function properly again. That's why I think ICT suits me perfectly.</p>
